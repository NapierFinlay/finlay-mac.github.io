	<h1>Final Boss</h1>

	<br>

	<p>
	<span>
	After you and Storm help each other to defeat Black Knight, behold, you saw a new door come in front of you once again. But it is different to the rest of normal
	doors, it have a much more powerful and thicker aura that make you to have chills on your body, that only make you to be <u style="color: red">determined</u> to
	forward.
	</span>
	</p>

	<br>

	<p>
	<span>
	You and Storm go through a door and you saw nothing but full of broken weapons lies down on the floor, making a big mess around you. Then, a sightly darker blue
	scarf figure came out behind the wall, carrying a longsword. It look like a proud knight who protect the throne that nobody sit on so he serves no one. You felt
	familiar when you face him as you feel like you have been here before but you simply don't bother about it as Artorias are getting ready to charge at you, hold
	tightly with his sword.

	<cite>"SUP SUP!"</cite>, another annoying voice. <cite>"This time, you have to make sure that you choose the right one as there is only one correct 
	choice. Alright? Good luck! :D"</cite>, he said as he just disappeared again but you still don't know where did he come from.
