	You don't summon any weapons, only your body and hands. Artorias was surprised to see you don't carry a weapon, he draw his sword and push it on the floor like
	a cross, as what a knight would do for honour. His knuckles cracked together as he approach you in a menace way and then, suddenly, he uses his speed to be front
	in you, punch you. You block his attack with your arms up, pushing you away from Artorias. He teleport behind you but you couldn't react his attack as he kick your
	back, crash into a stone wall, now a broken wall. You lie down on it and Artorias is in front of you already, he look down on your pathetic side so he 
	uses his force to pull a sword back to his hand and are about to strike you when Storm came to rescue you, jumping to protect you from Artorias's sword attack...

    	You hold Storm in your arms, left ton of blood on your body. Storm look at your eyes, whining quieter and quieter until it is completely silence in boss room.
	You felt full of negative emotions everywhere in you but all you know is that you are <u style="color: red">determined</u> to defeat Artorias, who felt fear from
	your pressure. You stand up and all of suddenly, you are already at the front of Artorias. Surprised at your attack, he take his sword and swing at you but you
	hold his sword. You tear his arm away from his body, left him a full of screaming and you took his sword to chop his head off. You finally defeat him but
	mourn your companion who lost their life until a shinning door appear behind you. You couldn't even let Storm's body rest in peace but there is no time to do so
	you move on to the final stage...
