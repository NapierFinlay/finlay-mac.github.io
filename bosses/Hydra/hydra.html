	You approach the door after you murder a innocent being but this time, it give sinister yet familiar presence to make you a bit hesitate to open
	it but you are too <u style="color: red">determined</u> to not stop here. As you enter a door, behold, you smell a fresh blue lake before you and when
	you are about to get closer when suddenly, a swirling round in a middle of a lake and there, a massive hideous creature came out! It snarl at you with its
	sharp teeth and ton of heads, at least 6 heads.

	<cite>"Ah, there we go! Hello human, it is me again :). This time, you have to think more clearly to make a decision as there is only one correct answer.
	Otherwise, I will leave it to your imagination..."</cite> as he said that, four grey windows with cyan text appear in front of you and you feel cautious
	to decide.
