	As dragon are about to use a fire breath to burn you to the death, you summon Dragonslayer and there, it is in your hand.
	It is quite heavy to wield but you manages to hold it well. You dodge a dragon breath and with all of your might on your
	legs, you jump all the way to dragon place. Your hands lift a big sword and cut the dragon's eye, leave a clean red mark
	on dragon's eye. Dragon was raged as you dare to hurt his precious eyes so his claw flap you away from him but you block it
	with your sword. You feel tired because of your powerful but heavy sword and you are becoming even more <u>determined</u>
	to kill a dragon. As a final struggles, you run toward a dragon again and his tail lift up to smash you but you slide down to
	avoid a dangerous tail. Once you are behind dragon, you, with all of your strength left, throw Dragonslayer at a dragon's
	back and it slash through his back, in a place of his heart. Dragon roared really loudly that it hurt your ears and he
	fall down.

	You feel really happy to pass the trial once again and suddenly, a shinning door appear in front of you. Look like you are
	almost at the end.
