Ensure that you follow the steps that my website need in order to bring it the full potential:
- Install a font called "BigBlueTerm437 Nerd Font" (It can be found in this link: https://www.nerdfonts.com/ )
- Install another font called "Source Code Pro" as well. I believe I installed it in Linux (I use Arch BTW) so I am not sure about Windows. 
- Allow audio in your browser to listen the background music.
