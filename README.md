Ensure that you have these things that you may browser in my website:
- Install a font called "BigBlueTerm437 Nerd Font" (It can be found in this link: https://www.nerdfonts.com/ )
- Install another font called "Source Code Pro" as well. I believe I installed it in Linux (I use Arch BTW) so I am not sure about Windows.
