	you would call me."</cite>, smiling at you. You wonder why would he rest in a strange, darkness places considering that there is possibility for
	monsters to came out of thin air. <cite>"Could you please help me to get up from my place? I rest here a bit too long and it was pretty cozy!"</cite>,
	expecting you to help him. Once again, black windows with cyan appear out of air in front of you and you notice that there is one window that caught
	your attention. <u style="color: #bf0808">"Murder him"</u>. You were shocked yet feel somehow familiar when you read it.
