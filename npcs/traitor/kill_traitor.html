	You decide to kill Judas who seems innocent to you but then you remember the warning sign back at the beginning. So, you
	summon your sword and stab his stomach while he let his guard down. <cite>"H-how did you know-"</cite> he said as 
	you pull your sword out of his stomach and his blood came out, he lies down and doesn't move anymore.
	You feel nothing at all when you look at your first murder. You simply move on to the next stage as another door appear as
	usual.
