	As you emerged victorious from the battle with Dark Wraith, your breaths ragged but triumphant. With the threat disappeared,
	you turned your attention to the next door that just appear after you defeat monster. You pushed open the door, revealing
	another completely different dungeon and before you stood another being, you jump back a bit and get ready for another fight
	but then you hear <cite>"Peace! I am not your enemy."</cite>, you saw a human being who walk toward you slowly.
	<cite>"My name is Judas and I am just like you, who struggle to live."</cite>, his head were bald and he got a slim
	black eyes. <cite>"Since we are here, we should become friends so we can work together to survive"</cite> 
	he said when he lead his hand to you, waiting for you to do a handshake with him. You are thinking when all of suddenly,
	two black windows came out of nowhere. You are not surprised anymore as you already get used to it but you notice one
	black window that stand out of other and this time, it isn't cyan but instead, red. It says:

	<b>"Kill him"</b>
	</span>
	</p>

	<br>

	<p>
	<span>
	You are shocked as you read it multiple times to check if you did read it correctly. But you have to make your decision
	in order to reach the end as you are determined.
