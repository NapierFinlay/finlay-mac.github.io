	After you enter a shinning door, there is completely darkness in your place for a few minutes as if it try to play with your mind. Until a brighter light came
	out of darkness from above your head and behold, a winged figure with a sword who look like a proud angel from the heaven. He also wear a armour that made out
	of pure gold, possibly only exist in such place. <cite>"Welcome, trialist, to the Last Stand. Here is where everyone who is worthy to reach the ending and
	they deserve a reward!"</cite> he said with a voice that sounds like a thunder. You felt a strange familiar feeling when you hear his voice, his voice is sightly
	different before as it have much deeper voice but you can tell that he spoke the same words he used so you ask a question to him about this theory. <cite>"Ah,
	you already found it out? Impressive, mortal. Yes, I am the one who give you a guidance back then and the reason I did it is because I just don't want to see
	such foolish mortal like you, without my guidance, to die too early so you can continue to entertainment me.", he proudly said. Now, you have one more
	question to ask but you are a bit hesitant to ask it to him as it may anger him but you are <u style="color: red">determined</u> to know the truth.
	You decide to ask it right away but he doesn't seem angry but rather, he is creepy smiling when he heard your question. <cite>"In the end, you don't know whose
	did this to you huh? Alright, since you are too dumb to think after one theory, I will tell you who. It was <u style="color: red">ME</u> HEHEHEHEHEHEHEHE"</cite>.
	You were massively shocked when you hear his answer, everything you did in this path and pass tough trials is nothing but entertainment to him...

	Suddenly, you saw three white windows appear in front of you which make you become confused as it wasn't done by this arrogant angel. Otherwise, he would mention
	it to you but you simply couldn't care about it, you just want to get out of this hellish place.
