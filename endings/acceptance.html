	You realise that it is pointless to put your anger on him because you made it to the end so you are very proud of yourself for not giving up until the end.
	So, you simply ignore this crazy angel and move forward where you can see the beautiful night with some white stars. There, you can see the bonfire in
	a abandoned building and you sit beside it, lie down on the wall with your back. It was a good jounery to get here.

	Bro doesn't have enemies. Good for you! Then you just relax your body, put your body down like your bed and feel sleeping but in a very cozy way.
	You close your eyes and then that is all what you think about. You felt something that touch you but you couldn't wake up so you just sleep through it.
