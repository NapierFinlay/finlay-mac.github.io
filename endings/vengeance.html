        <h1>You murder a creator!</h1>

	<p>
	<span>
	You feel the rage inside you when looking at your own creator because he force you to go through the trials in dungeon. You summon your favourite weapon and 
	grip it to jump up with all your might to land a deadly attack on your creator but creator doesn't do anything, just open his arms to you like a mother who
	want to hug their child. "Very interesting, you choose this path. This is so much fun! Although, I think you should be worried about yourself-" he said it as
	he couldn't stop his bleeding from his neck. You didn't expect to see a immortal angel would show a red blood like a normal person as he just lie there. But you
	wonder why would he say the last words to you when suddenly, you felt a really painful on your heart while you grab your chest where you heart would be. You fall
	down, couldn't breath at all. This is where you realise that this angel is basically your creator. Too late, you <u>died</u> there.

	I will give you another chance. Next time, don't die again okay? :D"</cite>
