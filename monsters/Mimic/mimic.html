	You couldn't wait to see what is in the chest and when you are about to open it, chest suddenly came to life and it opens it "mouth" 
	with horrible sharp teeth and try to eat your hands but it couldn't as you jump backward just in time to evade the snapping jaws.
	This creepy chest transformed its wooden sides into unholy arms and legs. It look at you, throw it tongue out as it look at you as its supper.
