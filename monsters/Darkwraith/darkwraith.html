	<h1>You choose the left door...</h1>

	<p>
	<span>
	Heart pounding, you approached the left door and you decide to open it. As you slowly open a door, dark pitch
	surround you and you see nothing but darkness, make you feel like someone who would crept up behind you but
	despite that, with courage you still walk through it. Then, a soft, ethereal light spilled forth, casting shadows 
	upon the tunnel's walls. You walk towards this light and behold, the sunlight filtering through
	a dense canopy of trees. A gentle breeze rustled the leaves, carrying with it the scent of earth and greenery.

	You are confused as there is two different places between you, one for darkness and other for light, it is as if
	it tell you that there is life and death in this strange place. As you go deeper into the woods, your senses tell
	you that you are being watched by unseen eyes. Suddenly, a tiny movement caught your attention
	- a shadow slithering through the underbrush, twisting and contorting like a serpent in the darkness. You watched
	as the shadow coalesced into a sinister form - a Dark Wraith, its presence loomed over you like a death specter.
	Its form distorted, like a nightmare given shape. With ice sword, it swing a sword around it, cause grass and trees to
	be into frozen woods like a unpredictable snow weather. Dark Wraith fixed its gaze upon you...

	<cite>"HEY!"</cite>, you hear someone who yelled at you but you see no one but Dark Wraith, eyes burning with an unholy light
	that sent shivers down your spine. <cite>"Don't worry, I am your helper and I will show you how to fight this mob."</cite>
	You feel relieved but also feel suspicious, <cite>"You can see three choices in front of you."</cite> When you hear that,
	three black  windows with cyan texts came out of nowhere, you didn't see it until now so that make you become curious
	but doesn't bother about it as Dark Wraith slowly walk toward you, with it massive sword leaving a line mark behind it.
	<cite>"You have to be careful to not make wrong decision. Otherwise, you died! :)"</cite>, this make you feel nervous but 
	more determined to survive.
