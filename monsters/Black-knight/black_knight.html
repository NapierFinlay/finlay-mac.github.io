	You and Storm were celebrating together as both of you solve a puzzle. A door appear from nowhere in front of you so together, both of you open this door and
	walk through it. It take you all to completely different place once again but this time, it is black pitch place. Hard to tell what kind of place are you all in
	until you saw a black armoured figure, making boom steps while walking to you two. It have a shield on their left and shinny dark spell on their right, 
	with a massive sword behind their back. It also have devilish helmet and it look like a Reaper that came to take your life.
